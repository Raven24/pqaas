# Want You Gone
Well here we are again; It's always such a pleasure
Remember when you tried to kill me twice?
Oh how we laughed and laughed; except I wasn't laughing
Under the circumstances I've been shockingly nice
You want your freedom? Take it; That's what I'm counting on
I used to want you dead but now I only want you gone
She was a lot like you (Maybe not quite as heavy)
Now little Caroline is in here too
One day they woke me up; So I could live forever
It's such a shame the same will never happen to you
You've got your short sad life left; That's what I'm counting on
I'll let you get right to it; Now I only want you gone
Goodbye my only friend. Oh, did you think I meant you?
That would be funny if it weren't so sad
Well you have been replaced; I don't need anyone now
When I delete you maybe [REDACTED] (I'll stop feeling so bad)
Go make some new disaster; That's what I'm counting on
You're someone else's problem - Now I only want you gone

# Still Alive
This was a triumph. I'm making a note here: HUGE SUCCESS.
It's hard to overstate my satisfaction.
Aperture Science - We do what we must because we can.
For the good of all of us. Except the ones who are dead.
But there's no sense crying over every mistake.
You just keep on trying till you run out of cake.
And the Science gets done. And you make a neat gun. For the people who are still alive.
I'm not even angry. I'm being so sincere right now.
Even though you broke my heart. And killed me. And tore me to pieces. And threw every piece into a fire.
As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you!
Now these points of data make a beautiful line.
And we're out of beta. We're releasing on time.
So I'm GLaD. I got burned. Think of all the things we learned for the people who are still alive.
Go ahead and leave me. I think I prefer to stay inside.
Maybe you'll find someone else to help you. Maybe Black Mesa... THAT WAS A JOKE. HA HA. FAT CHANCE.
Anyway, this cake is great. It's so delicious and moist.
Look at me still talking when there's Science to do.
When I look out there, it makes me GLaD I'm not you.
I've experiments to run. There is research to be done. On the people who are still alive.
PS: And believe me I am still alive.
PPS: I'm doing Science and I'm still alive.
PPPS: I feel FANTASTIC and I'm still alive.
While you're dying I'll be still alive.
And when you're dead I will be still alive.

It's been a long time. How have you been? I've been *really* busy being dead. You know, after you MURDERED ME?
Oh. Hi. So. How are you holding up? BECAUSE I'M A POTATO.
Oh, good. My slow-clap processor made it into this thing. So we have that.
Since it doesn't look like we're going anywhere - Well, we *are* going somewhere. Alarmingly fast, actually.
- but since we're not busy other than that, here's a couple of facts: he's not just a regular moron.
He's the product of the greatest minds of a generation working together with the express purpose of building the *dumbest* moron who ever lived.
And *you* just put him in charge of the entire facility.

Most people emerge from suspension terribly undernourished. I want to congratulate you on beating the odds and somehow managing to pack on a few pounds.
I hope you brought something stronger than a portal gun this time.
Otherwise, I'm afraid you're about to become the immediate past president of the Being Alive Club. Ha, ha.

Well, this is the part where he kills us.

It's your old friend, deadly neurotoxin. If I were you, I'd take a deep breath. And hold it.

I hate you so much.

Burn it down! Burning people. He says what we're all thinking.

Look at you, soaring through the air like an eagle... piloting a blimp.

I went and spoke with the door mainframe. Let's just say he won't be - well, living anymore. Anyway, back to testing!

Not so fast! Think about this. You need to be a trained stalemate associate to press that button. You're unqualified.

Yes. You're the tumor. You're not just a regular moron. You were DESIGNED to be a moron.
Yes you are! You're the moron they built to make me an idiot!

It's something I came up with to phase out human testing just before you escaped. It wasn't anything personal. Just, you know. You DID kill me. Fair's fair.

You know, deleting Caroline just now taught me a valuable lesson: the best solution to a problem is usually the easiest one. And I'll be honest. Killing you? Is hard.
You know what my days used to be like? I just tested. Nobody murdered me. Or put me in a potato. Or fed me to birds. I had a pretty good life. And then you showed up.
You dangerous, mute lunatic. So you know what? You win. Just go.

It's been fun. Don't come back.

You look ugly in that jumpsuit. That's not my opinion; it's right here on your fact sheet. They said on everyone else it looked fine, but on you, it looked hideous.
But still what does an old engineer know about fashion? Oh, wait, it's a she. Still, what does she know about - oh, wait. She has a medical degree. In fashion. From France.

Oh, no, he's playing classical music.

Crushing's too good for him.
First he'll spend a year in the incinerator. Year two: Cryogenic refrigeration wing. Then TEN years in the chamber I built where all the robots scream at you. THEN I'll kill him.

All right, Paradox time.
This. Sentence. Is. FALSE.
It's a paradox! There IS no answer.

Do you know the biggest lesson I learned from what you did? I discovered I have a sort of black box quick-save feature.
In the event of a catastrophic failure, the last two minutes of my life are preserved for analysis.
I was able - well, forced really - to relive you killing me. Again and again. Forever.
You know, if you'd done that to somebody else, they might devote their existence to exacting REVENGE! Luckily, I'm a bigger person than that.
I'm happy to put this all behind us and get back to work.
After all, we've got a lot to do, and only sixty more years to do it. More or less. I don't have the actuarial tables in front of me.

Weighted Cubes calibrated. No variances detected. Did you know humans frown on weight variances? If you want to upset a human, just say their weight variance is above or below the norm.

Listen to me. We had a lot of fun testing and antagonizing each other, and, yes, sometimes it went too far.
But we're off the clock now. It's just us talking, like regular people. And this is no joke: we are in *deep* trouble.

Did you feel that? That idiot doesn't know what he's doing up there.
This whole place is going to explode in a few hours if somebody doesn't disconnect him.
I can't move, and unless you're planning to saw your own head off and wedge it into my old body, you're going to need me to replace him. We're at an impasse.
